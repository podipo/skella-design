This repository holds resources that we use during the design process. They work hand in hand with the [Skella front end](https://github.com/podipo/skella/) and [Skella back end](https://github.com/podipo/skellago/) projects.

The first file we've shared is the Living Style Library for web sketch file that we use during visual design: [Download ~9MB](https://github.com/podipo/skella-design/blob/master/sketch/Living_Style_Library.sketch?raw=true).  When personas, scenarios, and user flows are fleshed out and visual design begins, this file helps us set up the grid and lay out the modules for different screen sizes.
